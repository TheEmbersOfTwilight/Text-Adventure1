# Warden's Sanctum

A short text-adventure about escape, discovery, and a mysterious sanctum.

Overview
--------
Warden's Sanctum is a compact Python text adventure in which you awaken in a grimy cell, discover a mysterious wand, and are swept into the sanctum of a powerful and suspicious figure. The game focuses on exploration, simple inventory flags, atmosphere created by a typed-text effect, and branching choices that change the outcome.

This repository contains the game code (Python) and the story/prose currently embedded in the code.
